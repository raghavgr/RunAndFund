## Functionality

Run & Fund is an iOS application that allows users to select their favorite charity organization and donate to it based on the number of miles they ran. The application gives users the opportunity to browse several different non-profit organizations and select the one appropriate for them. Then the user can select a fixed rate by which they would like their donations to be sent. Along with this, users can track their runs real-time and see essential quantitative details such as pace, distance, and duration.
